## My Process

### Build With
 - Node.js (MongoDB w/ Mongoose, Express, JS and EJS)
 - HTML
 - CSS (w/ Bootstrap)
 - Passport
 - JOI
 - Mapbox API
 - Cloudinary

### What I've learned?
The Web Dev Bootcamp Course is very time demanding and covers tons of features ([as you can see here](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)), so I've gone through the basics of 
Web Development in a broad perspective, enhancing my programming abilities. 

### What I could've done better?
As the number of campgrounds increases, pagination / infinite scrooling is likely a must have feature. Also, sorting features, like
sort by campground, is also a nice addition.
